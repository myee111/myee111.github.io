# Introduction
In this blog I share how I configured my Fedora 40 server to run Plex as a rootless Podman container.

[Podman](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/) is an open source tool that runs [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) compliant containers. This includes containers hosted at [docker hub.](https://hub.docker.com/) Podman can run containers in user accounts (ie. non-root accounts).

[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) lets you stream and share multimedia files. The nice thing about Plex is that it's supported on Apple TV and numerous other devices like set-top boxes and smart TVs.
